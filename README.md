## ✨ Overview

**Focusly** is a lightweight menu bar companion for macOS. It softens each display with a glassy overlay, keeps distractions under control, and gives you per-monitor ambience controls without getting in the way.

Focusly tracks the active window (with your permission) so the foreground content stays sharp while the rest of the desktop calmly fades back. Presets, per-display overrides, and localizations live directly inside the Swift Package so contributors can tweak everything with familiar tooling.

## ⚡️ Feature Highlights

## 🚀 Run the Alpha 0.2 Build

Precompiled alpha binaries are included for quick testing:

1. Mount `Focusly.dmg` and drag `Focusly.app` to `/Applications`.  
2. Control-click the app → **Open**, confirm under **System Settings › Privacy & Security**.  
3. Grant Accessibility permission: **System Settings › Privacy & Security › Accessibility** → enable **Focusly**.  
4. The menu bar icon appears — toggle **Enable Overlays** to begin.

> _If your workspace suddenly feels too cozy, that’s Focusly doing its job — or maybe you just need another café solo._

You can always grab the latest `.dmg` for **Alpha 0.2** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/your-user/macos-focusly/releases).

---

## 🧠 Build from Source (Alpha 0.2)

To build the latest alpha version directly from source using Xcode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/macos-focusly.git
cd macos-focusly
xcodebuild -scheme Focusly -configuration Release
```

Or open the project manually:

1. Launch **Xcode 15+**  
2. Open `Package.swift`  
3. Select the **Focusly** scheme  
4. Hit **⌘R** to build and run  

The built `.app` will appear under:  
```
.build/release/Focusly.app
```

---

## 📦 Bundle & Distribution

- `./build_app.sh` → Builds an unsigned `Focusly.app` from the latest Swift build.  
- `./build_dmg.sh` → Packages `Focusly.app` and documentation into a shareable `.dmg`.  
- Prefer `swift build -c release` before packaging for optimized binaries.

---

## 🔐 Signing the App Bundle

The generated `Focusly.app` ships unsigned, so macOS Gatekeeper will flag it until you apply a signature.

**Quick option via Homebrew cask**

```bash
brew install --cask alienator88-sentinel
alienator88-sentinel sign Focusly.app \
  --identity "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
```

- Replace the identity with your Developer ID certificate name (or use `--identity "-"` for ad-hoc signing while testing).  
- Run `spctl --assess --type exec Focusly.app` to confirm Gatekeeper now trusts the bundle.

Public releases posted to GitHub will ship pre-signed and notarized so Gatekeeper opens them without extra prompts.

---

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- **Accessibility:** Falls back to CoreGraphics polling if permission is denied (masking quality reduced).  
- **Debug Overlay:** Enable with `FOCUSLY_DEBUG_WINDOW=1` to visualize the window tracker.  
- **Launch at Login:** Available only when running from a bundled `.app`.  
- **Localization:** Preferences allow runtime language overrides; translation files live in `Sources/Focusly/Resources/*.lproj`.  
- **Onboarding:** Reset onboarding in Preferences to rerun the guided setup.

---

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
swift test
```

The suite currently covers:
- `ProfileStore` persistence  
- Preset override behavior  

Further tests will be added as more logic moves outside the UI layer.
