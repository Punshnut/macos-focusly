# Focusly Settings & First-Run Guide

This guide walks through the macOS settings window and the first-run tips that help Focusly keep distractions out of view.

## Opening Focusly Settings
- Launch Focusly and look for the status bar icon (Minimal Dot, Halo, or Equalizer depending on your current style).
- Click the icon and choose `Preferences…`, or press `⌘,` while Focusly is active, to open the Preferences window.
- The window is scrollable; sections flow from appearance tweaks to automation and language.

## Settings Dialog Tour

### Appearance
- `Overlay Preset`: Pick Blur (Focus), Warm, Colorful, or Monochrome. Switching presets updates every display instantly.
- `Status Bar Icon`: Toggle between Minimal Dot, Halo, and Equalizer to match your menu bar.
- Tip: Pair a softer preset with the icon style that is easiest to glance at without pulling focus.

### Window Tracking Performance
- Choose Standard (60 Hz), Energy Saving (30 Hz), or High Performance (90 Hz) to tailor how often Focusly tracks window movement.
- The caption explains how the selected profile affects responsiveness and battery life.
- Tip: Standard is a good balance; switch to High Performance when you rely on rapid window rearranging.

### Displays
- Each detected screen appears as a chip. Click a chip to tune that display.
- Use `Exclude This Display` when you need Focusly to skip a screen entirely.
- **Blurring Details**: Drag the `Blur Style` slider to sample macOS materials—HUD Window, Menu, Popover, Sidebar, Sheet, Full Screen, or Window Background—and pick the texture that matches your workspace.
- **Color Effects**: Adjust `Overlay Strength`, tweak the `Overlay Tint`, and switch between `Preserve Color` and `Monochrome`.
- **Standard Settings**: `Reset to Preset` reverts the current display; `Apply to Other Displays` copies the look to the rest of your setup.
- Tip: Reduce opacity on secondary displays to keep reference content visible while still muting distractions.

### Shortcut
- Toggle **Enable Focus Toggle Shortcut** to activate the global hotkey.
- Press **Record** to capture a combination (for example, `⌃⌥⌘F`), and use **Clear** to remove it.
- Tip: Choose a combination that is easy to hit with one hand so you can momentarily show the desktop without breaking flow.

### Launch at Login
- Enable **Launch Focusly at login** so overlays start with macOS. If macOS blocks the setting, Focusly shows instructions for resolving it in System Settings → Users & Groups → Login Items.
- Tip: Launching at login keeps overlays consistent across reboots and external display sessions.

### App Language
- Choose **App Language** to override macOS defaults, switch instantly between translations, and preview contributions.
- Tip: Leave the picker on “Follow macOS Language (Default)” to stay in sync with system preferences.

### Revisit Introduction
- Click `Revisit Introduction…` to reopen the onboarding walkthrough at any time.
- You can also trigger it from the status bar menu (`Show Introduction…`).

## First-Startup Tips for Staying Focused
1. **Switch overlays on**: From the quick menu, toggle `Enable Overlays` for each monitor to soften background clutter.
2. **Pick a preset per space**: Blur (Focus) is ideal for neutral focus, Warm suits evening work, Colorful brightens presentations, and Monochrome keeps reference monitors subtle.
3. **Dial in per-display tuning**: Adjust overlay strength lower on displays where you keep messaging apps, and increase blur on the main workspace to block busy wallpapers.
4. **Set your controls**: Capture a global shortcut you can tap whenever you need to reveal your desktop, and enable Launch at Login so Focusly is always ready.
5. **Revisit onboarding after changes**: Any time you rearrange displays or swap presets, relaunch the introduction from the status bar to refresh muscle memory for the quickest controls.
