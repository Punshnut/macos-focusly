# Focusly Settings & First-Run Guide

This guide walks through the macOS settings window and the first-run tips that help Focusly keep distractions out of view.

## Opening Focusly Settings
- Launch Focusly and look for the status bar icon (Dot, Halo, or Equalizer depending on your current style).
- Click the icon and choose `Settings…`, or press `⌘,` while Focusly is active, to open the Preferences window.
- The window is scrollable; sections are arranged from visual appearance to automation.

## Settings Dialog Tour

### Appearance
- `Overlay Preset`: Pick Blur (Focus), Warm, Colorful, or Monochrome. Switching presets updates every display instantly.
- `Status Bar Icon`: Choose the icon shape that best blends with the rest of your menu bar.
- Tip: Pair a softer preset with the icon style that is easiest to glance at without pulling focus.

### Displays
- Each detected screen appears as a chip. Click a chip to tune that display.
- Use the live preview block to judge opacity (`Color Filter`), blur radius, and tint.
- `Options` → `Reset This Display` reverts the slider values; `Copy settings to other displays` keeps multi-monitor rigs consistent.
- Tip: Reduce opacity on secondary displays to keep reference content visible while still muting distractions.

### Hotkey
- Use the **Enable Overlay Shortcut** toggle, then record a key combination (for example, `⌃⌥⌘F`) to quickly toggle overlays.
- `Clear` removes the shortcut; disables with the toggle if you need to avoid conflicts.
- Tip: Choose a combination that is easy to hit with one hand so you can momentarily show the desktop without breaking flow.

### Launch at Login
- Enable **Launch Focusly at Login** so overlays start with macOS. If macOS blocks the setting, a short message explains what to do in System Settings → Users & Groups → Login Items.
- Tip: Launching at login keeps overlays consistent across reboots and external display sessions.

### Revisit Introduction
- Click `Revisit Introduction…` to reopen the onboarding walkthrough at any time.
- You can also trigger it from the status bar menu (`Show Introduction…`).

## First-Startup Tips for Staying Focused
1. **Switch overlay filters on**: From the status bar quick menu, enable overlays for each monitor to soften background clutter.
2. **Pick a filter per space**: Blur (Focus) is ideal for neutral focus, Warm suits evening work, Colorful brightens presentations, and Monochrome keeps reference monitors subtle.
3. **Dial in per-display tuning**: Adjust opacity lower on displays where you keep messaging apps, and increase blur on the main workspace to block busy wallpapers.
4. **Set your controls**: Capture a global shortcut you can tap whenever you need to reveal your desktop, and enable Launch at Login so Focusly is always ready.
5. **Revisit onboarding after changes**: Any time you rearrange displays or swap presets, relaunch the introduction from the status bar to refresh muscle memory for the quickest controls.
