# Focusly Settings & First-Run Guide

This guide walks through the macOS settings window and the first-run tips that help Focusly keep distractions out of view.

## Opening Focusly Settings
- Launch Focusly and look for the status bar icon (Standard Icon, Halo, or Equalizer depending on your current style).
- Click the icon and choose `Preferences…`, or press `⌘,` while Focusly is active, to open the Preferences window.
- The window is scrollable; sections flow from appearance tweaks to automation and language.

## Settings Dialog Tour

### Appearance
- `Focus Preset`: Pick Smart Blur, Warm, Ocean, or Monochrome. Switching presets updates every display instantly.
- `Status Bar Icon`: Toggle between Standard Icon, Halo, and Equalizer to match your menu bar.
- Tip: Pair a softer preset with the icon style that is easiest to glance at without pulling focus.

### Window Tracking Performance
- Choose Standard (60 Hz), Energy Saving (30 Hz), or High Performance (90 Hz) to tailor how often Focusly tracks window movement.
- The caption explains how the selected profile affects responsiveness and battery life.
- Tip: Standard is a good balance; switch to High Performance when you rely on rapid window rearranging.

### Displays
- Each detected screen appears as a chip. Click a chip to tune that display.
- Use `Exclude This Display` when you need Focusly to skip a screen entirely.
- **Blurring Details**: Drag the `Blur Style` slider to sample macOS materials—HUD Window, Menu, Popover, Sidebar, Sheet, Full Screen, or Window Background—and pick the texture that matches your workspace.
- **Color Effects**: Adjust `Overlay Strength`, tweak the `Overlay Tint`, and switch between `Preserve Color` and `Monochrome`.
- **Standard Settings**: `Reset to Preset` reverts the current display; `Apply to Other Displays` copies the look to the rest of your setup.
- Tip: Reduce opacity on secondary displays to keep reference content visible while still muting distractions.

### Shortcuts
- Each hotkey row has its own toggle and Record/Clear buttons, making it easy to run multiple actions from the keyboard.
- **Toggle Focusly overlays**: Show or hide the blur/tint effect without reaching for the mouse. Pick something like `⌃⌥⌘F` so it never collides with app shortcuts.
- **Cycle masking mode**: Flip between “Focused window only” and “All windows from the frontmost app” just like a shift-click on the status icon. Great for apps that spawn multiple floating tools.
- Tip: Capture distinct shortcuts so you can build muscle memory—one combo to dim everything, another to promote extra app windows when you need them.

### Launch at Login
- Enable **Launch Focusly at login** so overlays start with macOS. If macOS blocks the setting, Focusly shows instructions for resolving it in System Settings → Users & Groups → Login Items.
- Tip: Launching at login keeps overlays consistent across reboots and external display sessions.

### App Language
- Choose **App Language** to override macOS defaults, switch instantly between translations, and preview contributions.
- Tip: Leave the picker on “Follow macOS Language (Default)” to stay in sync with system preferences.

### Revisit Introduction
- Click `Revisit Introduction…` to reopen the onboarding walkthrough at any time.
- You can also trigger it from the status bar menu (`Show Introduction…`).

## First-Startup Tips for Staying Focused
1. **Switch overlays on**: From the quick menu, toggle `Enable Overlays` for each monitor to soften background clutter.
2. **Shift-click for focus**: Holding Shift while clicking the status icon cycles between masking just the focused window or every window in the active app, per display.
3. **Pick a preset per space**: Smart Blur is ideal for neutral focus, Warm suits evening work, Ocean brightens presentations, and Monochrome keeps reference monitors subtle.
4. **Dial in per-display tuning**: Adjust overlay strength lower on displays where you keep messaging apps, and increase blur on the main workspace to block busy wallpapers.
5. **Set your controls**: Capture both hotkeys—one for enabling overlays, one for cycling the masking mode—and enable Launch at Login so Focusly is always ready.
6. **Revisit onboarding after changes**: Any time you rearrange displays or swap presets, relaunch the introduction from the status bar to refresh muscle memory for the quickest controls.
